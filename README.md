# Scraping_Dynamique_site
I'm trying to collect data of cars from a dynamique website using scrapy with post method.\
I had to use the post method many times in the same page, so the scraping was a little bit slow, 51 items per minute.\
I'm trying to find a better solution.

# dataset:
The dataset collected contains the following columns:\
-'Ausfuhrung' : The name of model.\
-'Lifertermin': Information about deleviry.\
-'Stuck': Type of stuck.\
-'inkl	': More information about deleviry.\
-'name': The product name.\
-'price': The product price.\
